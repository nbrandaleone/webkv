# webkv

A Clojure web-based API server, which acts as a key-value store.
It creates a small file with the same name as the key. The value
is stored inside the file.

The files are written to the "/tmp" directory.

The API server accepts HTTP PUT and GET for storing
and retrieving values.

There is an included Dockerfile, meant to build this code using GraalVM.
The container is hosted on DockerHub: nbrand/webkv:0.1.

This program is meant as a learning example only.
Use redis for a production grade Key-Value store.
